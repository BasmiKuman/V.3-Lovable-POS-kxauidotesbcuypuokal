-- 1. Check if handle_new_user function exists and has correct definition
SELECT

-- 2. Check if trigger exists on auth.users
SELECT

  event_object_table,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'users'
AND trigger_schema = 'auth';

-- 3. Check if old GPS trigger is removed
SELECT

-- 4. Check profiles table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'profiles'

-- 5. Check user_roles table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable

-- 6. Check rider_gps_settings table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable

-- 7. Check RLS policies on profiles
SELECT

  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'profiles'

-- 8. Check RLS policies on user_roles
SELECT

-- 9. Test if we can read from profiles (should work for authenticated users)
-- This will show current user's profile if logged in
SELECT

  full_name,
  phone,
  address,
  created_at
FROM profiles
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- 10. Check if there are any recent errors in logs (if available)
-- Note: This might not work depending on permissions
